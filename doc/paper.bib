abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the manufacturing industry in several directions. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a powder bed fusion AM process, has been dramatically accepted in various industries due to its versatility with several materials, including alloys. This comprehensive review article primarily explains the basic principle of the LPBF process, scientific and technological progress of several inter-related parameters, feedstock materials, produced properties/defects, and insights of numerical modelling to virtually understand the process behavior. Specific attention has been given to selective laser-meted (LPBFed) properties, driven through the microstructure formations and, thereby, concerning defects. The scope of the post-processing techniques to refine microstructure has also been discussed in this review paper. It has been identified that the defects are vital in LPBF process and are primarily governed by the process parameters. Therefore, a wisely chosen, optimized set of parameters can play a crucial role in minimizing defects considerably. Finally, the numerical modeling discussed in this review paper will help the researchers understand the LPBF process.}

In this work, 17-4 stainless steel components were manufactured in densely populated build volumes, simulating at-scale LPBF production. Tests revealed extreme variability in fatigue life data, analyzed via rigorous statistical tools. The El-Haddad model, modified for finite-life, enabled defect-based life prediction. Specimen location within the build volume correlated to life, which was heteroscedastic. Investigating defect concentration over the build volume explained typical life and scatter. These findings argue for qualification approaches which acknowledge high material lot variability.}

abstract = {Processing defects remain the primary cause for fatigue failure of laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) produced components. Accordingly, process mapping methodologies have been extensively developed to identify optimal processing parameters to avoid defects. For structure-critical applications, it is necessary to validate the defect-based process map through fatigue testing. We quantify the defect structure (porosity) process map for PBF-LB Ti-6Al-4V based on defect populations and fatigue properties. The defect populations were measured in samples fabricated at constant power and small increments in scanning velocity using X-ray micro-computed tomography and 2D metallography and analyzed using a number density approach. Furthermore, 4-point bend fatigue testing was used to establish stress-cycles to failure properties. Our results reveal distinct defect populations in both keyhole and lack-of-fusion defect regimes, with continuous variation in defect density. The number density-based defect size quantity strongly correlates with process parameters, peak stress, and initiating defect size, offering a quantitative approach to establish process-defect-fatigue relationships. We conclude that the process window exists just as clearly for fatigue as it does for defects, although more sensitive to variability in defects. Consequently, within this fatigue-based process window, one can expect to consistently produce dense components with superior fatigue properties.}

abstract = {Powder bed fusion-laser beam (PBF-LB) parts experience a significant decline in fatigue performance when process-induced defects are present. In this work, a decline in 4-point bend fatigue life was observed in PBF-LB Ti–6Al–4V coupons fabricated at constant power with increasing scanning velocity and which underwent subsequent stress relief and surface machining. Specifically, the presence of pores that resemble lack-of-fusion (LoF) and a decline in fatigue life were observed at scanning velocities lower than that expected from prior published work. It was hypothesized that this unexpected presence of LoF pores resulted from melt pool geometry variability that was not considered in prior work when the LoF criterion was implemented. Further, these pores can be small in size and infrequent in their occurrence when the melt pool geometry variability is not severe. Such sparse pores are challenging to characterize using conventional 2D characterization methods. This work leverages tall and narrow coupon geometry and high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (X-μCT) to capture LoF porosity. The results show that a modified melt pool overlap-based LoF criterion considering melt pool geometry variability captures the unexpected occurrence of LoF pores observed in X-μCT. In addition, the LoF percent metric displays a strongly negative correlation with fatigue performance. The insights from this work provide guidance on characterizing melt pool geometry variability across scan lines to systematically evaluate processing parameters that generate LoF pores, which, in turn, could lower fatigue performance.}

The inputs into the simulation are hatch spacing, layer thickness, and melt-pool cross-sectional area. Melt-pool areas used in the simulations can be obtained from experiments, or estimated with the analytical Rosenthal equation. The necessary material constants, including absorptivity for laser-based melting, have been collated for alloy steels, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys. Comparison with several data sets from the literature shows that the simulations correctly predict process conditions at which lack-of-fusion porosity becomes apparent, as well as the rate at which porosity increases with changes in process conditions such as beam speed, layer thickness and hatch spacing.}

Accordingly, this paper presents Defect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) as a means of quantifying the role of porosity as an exemplary defect structure in powder bed printed materials. Synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (μSXCT) was used to demonstrate that metal AM defects follow predictable trends within processing parameter space for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) materials. Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks were fabricated on an EOS M290 utilizing variations in laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing. In general, characteristic under-melting or lack-of-fusion defects were discovered in the low laser power, high scan velocity region of process space via μSXCT. These defects were associated with insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and can be avoided through the application of a lack-of-fusion criterion using melt pool geometric modeling. Large-scale keyhole defects were also successfully mitigated for estimated melt pool morphologies associated with shallow keyhole front wall angles. Process variable selections resulting in deep keyholes, i.e., high laser power and low scan velocity, exhibit a substantial increase of spherical porosity as compared to the nominal (manufacturer recommended) processing parameters for Ti-6Al-4 V. Defects within fully-dense process space were also discovered, and are associated with gas porosity transfer to the AM test blocks during the laser-powder interaction. Overall, this work points to the fact that large-scale defects in LPBF materials can be successfully predicted and thus mitigated/minimized via appropriate selection of processing parameters.}

The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down).

abstract = {Despite continuous technological enhancements of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, the lack of process repeatability and stability still represents a barrier for the industrial breakthrough. The most relevant metal AM applications currently involve industrial sectors (e.g. aerospace and bio-medical) where defects avoidance is fundamental. Because of this, there is the need to develop novel in situ monitoring tools able to keep under control the stability of the process on a layer-by-layer basis, and to detect the onset of defects as soon as possible. On the one hand, AM systems must be equipped with in situ sensing devices able to measure relevant quantities during the process, a.k.a. process signatures. On the other hand, in-process data analytics and statistical monitoring techniques are required to detect and localize the defects in an automated way. This paper reviews the literature and the commercial tools for in situ monitoring of powder bed fusion (PBF) processes. It explores the different categories of defects and their main causes, the most relevant process signatures and the in situ sensing approaches proposed so far. Particular attention is devoted to the development of automated defect detection rules and the study of process control strategies, which represent two critical fields for the development of future smart PBF systems.}

abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) technology has greatly matured in recent years driven by numerous industrial applications. However, lack-of-fusion (LoF) porosity is a significant challenge during PBF, and LoF pores can form even when processing with optimized deposition parameters. This paper proposes an analytical approach for simulating LoF porosity during PBF AM on the basis of a semi-elliptical model of the melt pool cross-section. Melted area, reference area, and LoF area fraction calculations are developed for the case where only one layer melts the reference area because of a shallow melt pool. In more complex cases where two layers melt a portion of the initial layer, the melted volume, reference volume, and LoF volume fraction calculations are developed using a change of coordinate system and integration. Finally, the model is extended to an arbitrary number of layers by assuming LoF porosity exponentially decays as the number of interacting layers increases. The analytical model predicts LoF porosity for both identical and variable melt pools and enables uncertainty analysis for LoF porosity calculations through the rapid sampling of a large number of experimentally-determined melt pool geometries. The model is used to calculate porosity fraction across the melt pool depth, melt pool width, hatch spacing, and layer thickness processing space. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated through comparisons with experimental data, and the effect of melt pool geometric uncertainty on the PBF process window is demonstrated through experimental comparisons. A new LoF porosity criterion for variable melt pools is proposed that simplifies to a previously defined, widely used LoF porosity criterion in the case of identical melt pools. Overall, the new approach presented provides a straightforward, low computational cost method for calculating LoF porosity that incorporates uncertainty for PBF AM processing.}

High-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging was used to track the movements of Al and Sn liquids, and also to examine elemental distributions in the laser tracks, complimented by electron microscopy after solidification. Key aspects, including melt pool geometry, keyhole instability, and flow dynamics (flow pattern and velocity), were examined using digital image analysis. Relatively deeper melt pools formed at 400 W and 300 mm/s exhibited greater stability, with smooth surfaces, consistent outward flow, and minor vortices near the keyhole. In contrast, shallower pools produced at higher scanning speeds (>500 mm/s) demonstrated greater instability with increased surface waviness, and stronger velocity fluctuations, leading to numerous micro-vortices and increased Al-Sn heterogeneity. Velocity scale estimations, supported by experimental observations, examined the roles of vapour pressure, Marangoni effect, buoyancy, inertial, and surface tension forces in the flow. The results revealed that vapour pressure and mechanical waves dominated at high scanning speeds (shallow pools), while Marangoni forces were equally significant in deep pools at lower speeds (300 mm/s). Buoyancy was found to have minimal impact in both cases. Furthermore, the interaction between inertial and surface tension forces played a critical role in determining the degree of waviness of the pools’ surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights into melt pool dynamics during laser processing of immiscible alloys and other metallic systems using elemental powders, and provide guidance for developing high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics models.}

However, as laser powder-bed fusion (PBF-L) additive manufacturing (AM) advances towards reliable production of titanium parts, a thorough understanding of the process-structure-properties (PSP) relationships remain to be fully understood. A study of the laser melting was paired with high-speed X-ray synchrotron imaging at the 32-ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Simultaneous melting and imaging was carried out on a Ti-6Al-4V powder layer held in a custom device designed to mimic single-track scans of the PBF-L process at different laser power levels, powder size distributions, and cover gas environments (Ar and He) on top of AM Ti-6Al-4V base metal. It was found that the thickness of the powder layer significantly affected the melt behavior: too much powder led to the formation of molten droplets that wetted the surface of the titanium, yet did not contribute to a uniform melting profile. Residual gas pores in the atomized powder were also observed to contribute to the pores observed in the melt pool, with the porosity of the powder (defined as volume of pores divided by total material volume) constant with powder size distribution (i.e., larger particles contained more entrapped gas, which increased final part porosity). When varying Ar or He through the same gas flow meter settings and nozzle, the difference in flow rates likely contributed more to the resultant porosity of the solidified material than did the thermal conductivity of the gasses, with He being the greater contributor to porosity. The microstructure of the heat affected zone contained α′, α, and an increased β phase fraction relative to the base material. The crystallographic texture of the melt pool region adopted that of the base metal.}

We show that LOF pores are not simply a void but a complex structure comprising oxide films decorating pore walls and grain refined regions with dislocation structures surrounding the pore. The formation of a thin nanocrystalline metallic layer on the pore wall is also observed. Spatter particles are the source of most LOF structures at high densities typical of recommended processing conditions and can only be eliminated by careful selection of processing parameters.

Damage indicator parameters, such as the plastic strain accumulation, elastic stress anisotropy, resolved shear stress and triaxiality, obtained from the CP simulations are used to identify the most probable locations of crack initiation. Pores are explicitly added to the microstructure instantiations in a systematic manner by varying the size, location, and proximity between pores. The critical pore size is defined as the size beyond which the location of crack nucleation transitions from crystallographic features to the pore vicinity, which is determined to be 20 μm in the material of interest with an average grain size of 48 μm. This work is beneficial in qualifying SLM materials given the natural porosity inherent to the manufacturing process, by reducing the number of fatigue experiments.}
