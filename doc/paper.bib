abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the manufacturing industry in several directions. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a powder bed fusion AM process, has been dramatically accepted in various industries due to its versatility with several materials, including alloys. This comprehensive review article primarily explains the basic principle of the LPBF process, scientific and technological progress of several inter-related parameters, feedstock materials, produced properties/defects, and insights of numerical modelling to virtually understand the process behavior. Specific attention has been given to selective laser-meted (LPBFed) properties, driven through the microstructure formations and, thereby, concerning defects. The scope of the post-processing techniques to refine microstructure has also been discussed in this review paper. It has been identified that the defects are vital in LPBF process and are primarily governed by the process parameters. Therefore, a wisely chosen, optimized set of parameters can play a crucial role in minimizing defects considerably. Finally, the numerical modeling discussed in this review paper will help the researchers understand the LPBF process.}
